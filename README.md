# Obrt

A generational arena with runtime borrow checking for the Rust Programming Language

This is a companion project to [Bort](https://github.com/Radbuglet/bort). Its eventual goal is to become a dependency of Bort and implement an alternative component-mode better suited for object-orientation. Because it may be of use to other projects, this portion of the project has been isolated into its own crate.
